# Digit Recognizer

For more information, please refer to Report.pdf

Handwritten digit recognition is a well-known image recognition concept. In this work, I would like to do some analysis using Python on MNIST dataset from Digit Recognizer Kaggle competition. I used PCA, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Adaboost, Random Forest and Neural Network classifiers on this dataset. I also used cross validation to figure out the best parameter for each model and evaluate modelsâ€™ performance.
